Notes from Alterawneh: 

- perfluoropentanoic acid (C4F9COOH)
- focused only on gas phase reactions
- submodel consists of 56 reactions and 45 species
    - new features of submodel: 
        - formation of n-C4F9 radical
        - abstraction of hydroxyl H by O/H radicals
        - fragmentation of the n-C4F9 radical
        - reactions between HF and perfluoropentanoic acid 
        - reactions between HF and C3F7COF
        - cyclisation reactions 
- illustrates formation of many small CnFm and CnHFm compounds from 800-1500K
- modeling used a PFR model at 1 atm, 500-1500 K, and a residence time of 25 s.
    - Inlet stream consists of 2% mol of perfluoropentanoic acid (M0) in N2 (i.e., purely pyrolytic conditions). 

-results: 
    - At 1500 K, predict emission of êž‰CF2 (biradical difluorocarbene), HF, CO2, CO, CF4, C2F6, C2F4
    - < 1400 K, the formation of 1H-nonafluorobutane (C4HF9), phosgene (COF2), and heptafluorobutanoyl fluoride (C3F7COF), with 1-C4F8,
        2-C4F8 and C3HF7 persisting to 1500 K. 
    - concludes that gas-phase pyrolysis by itself can convert PFAS to HF and short chain fluorocarbons
    
    
Notes for generating RMG model: 

- first try, PFPA model takes about one hour to run
